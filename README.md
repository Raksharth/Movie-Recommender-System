Hey Viewers!
The "Movie Recommender System" project uses the "content-based" tag methodology to provide the user with other movie recommendations after an initial selection.
Used 'Numpy' and 'Pandas' for cleaning, and defined functions to transform the data.
The model utilized 'Text Vectorization' using 'CountVectorizer', 'NLP' Library to stem the words, and "Cosine Similarity" for grouping similar movies.
Also, used the PyCharm IDE to create the app for the deployment through Streamlit.
